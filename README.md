# AMMnet Hackathon

## A virtual hackathon series for continual learning

A new virtual hackathon series for continual learning was developed by a collaborative effort between the Best Practices and Learning Committees.

Aims:

-   To create a continual support space that anyone can access
-   To learn how to code and how to code better
-   To upskill people from a distance, ultimately improving all our abilities in:
    -   data handling, presentation and analysis
    -   experimental design
    -   quantitative understanding
    -   coding and problem solving
    -   transmission modelling
-   To collaborate better and more equitably

### Structure

-   A theme is selected by the committee
-   Experts sign up to support specific themed areas
-   A participant submits a coding related problem for consideration within a specific theme
-   Experts select 2 – 3 problems per session on the chosen theme, and prepare some solutions to present

Experts will work with the Hackathon Committee for a half a day to consider the problems submitted and draft solutions. Once solutions are ready for a hackathon audience, they will present these during a 2-hour training session. Once the 2-hour training session concludes, experts will summarize the session, adapt solutions, and upload them to the shared space. A recording of the training will also be provided.


### Become an expert!

If you are an expert in the following topic areas, we need your help!

-   Data handling
-   Visualisation 
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Power calculations
-   Regression statistics
-   Mechanistic modelling
-   Bayesian statistics

Why volunteer as an expert? The best way to learn is to teach. You’ll also have an opportunity to network and gain professional visibility within the AMMnet community.

### Navigating the Github

Each Hackathon session will have it own folder in this Github repo that will contain all code and data files needed to participate. For example, materials for the [Hackathon on Data Visualization](https://ammnet.github.io/ammnet-hackathon/posts/data-vis/) in R can be found in the folder called `01_data-vis`.

You can either download those files directly from the folder, or you can clone this entire respository (including the files used to make our [Hackathon Blog](https://ammnet.github.io/ammnet-hackathon/)).
