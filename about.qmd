## A virtual hackathon series for continual learning

A new virtual hackathon series for continual learning was developed by a collaborative effort between the Best Practices and Learning Committees.

Aims:

-   To create a continual support space that anyone can access
-   To learn how to code and how to code better
-   To upskill people from a distance, ultimately improving all our abilities in:
    -   data handling, presentation and analysis
    -   experimental design
    -   quantitative understanding
    -   coding and problem solving
    -   transmission modelling
-   To collaborate better and more equitably

Structure:

-   A theme is selected by the committee
-   Experts sign up to support specific themed areas
-   A participant submits a coding related problem for consideration within a specific theme
-   Experts select 2 – 3 problems per session on the chosen theme, and prepare some solutions to present

Experts will work with the Hackathon Committee for a half a day to consider the problems submitted and draft solutions. Once solutions are ready for a hackathon audience, they will present these during a 2-hour training session. Once the 2-hour training session concludes, experts will summarize the session, adapt solutions, and upload them to the shared space. A recording of the training will also be provided.

If you are an expert in the following topic areas, we need your help!

-   Data handling
-   Visualisation 
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Power calculations
-   Regression statistics
-   Mechanistic modelling
-   Bayesian statistics

Why volunteer as an expert? The best way to learn is to teach. You’ll also have an opportunity to network and gain professional visibility within the AMMnet community.
